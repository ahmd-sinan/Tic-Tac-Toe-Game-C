# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-(Console Based using C)
A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using the C programming language.
This is a console-based game where two players take turns playing as X and O.


Features
---------
- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O),
- Interactive console-based board,
- Valid move checking (prevents overwriting moves),
- Automatic win detection (rows, columns, diagonals),
- Draw detection after 9 moves,


Concepts Used
-------------
2D Arrays,
Functions & modular programming,
Conditional statements,
Loops,
Game logic & state management,


How to Run
-----------
1.  Compile the program:
    ```bash
    gcc TicTacToe.c -o tictactoe
    ```
2.  Run the executable:
    ```bash

Player 1: X | Player 2: O
Enter a number (1–9) to place your mark.
First player to align 3 symbols wins!


Purpose
---------
This project was created to strengthen logic building, array handling, and function usage in C.
It is part of my learning journey in mastering core programming concepts.
